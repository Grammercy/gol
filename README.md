# gol
A resizable GOL(Game Of Life) simulation programmed in Golang using sdl!!!!!!!!!!
You can increase the size using wasd, and decrease the size using WASD. It starts with a random configuration of alive, and dead cells. You can re randomize or clear it using the r, and c keys respectively. You can pause using space, and pass a single frame using f. You can also draw on the screen which will either draw cells alive, or dead depending on where you initially clicked. PR if you want idk man.
